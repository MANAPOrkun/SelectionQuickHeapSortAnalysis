# SelectionQuickHeapSortAnalysis

<b>Work Description</b>

Given three sorting methods: Selection Sort, Heap Sort, and Quick Sort. An analysis of the time complexity for each method and comparison of experimental results must be performed.

The time complexity analysis of each algorithm consists of these steps. 

• Create and test the software for the implementation and visualization for each of given algorithms. 

• Determine experimentally and plot the program execution time as a function of the number of items to 
be sorted. 

• Establish theoretically and plot the relationship between the algorithm execution time (number of 
operations) and the number of elements under sorting. 

• Compare the experimental and theoretical dependence plots of each sorting algorithm. 

A comparison of the experimentally determined complexity of the three algorithms must be done in the same 
graphical window. 

Python and PyGame library equipment are chosen for the implementation of algorithms.
